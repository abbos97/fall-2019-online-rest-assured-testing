https://cybertek-ui-names.herokuapp.com/api/

This is the repo for uinames.com. Feel free to contribute to the project by adding names. Keep in mind that more isn't better. Quality over quantity. Quality being the most common/popular names in a region.

The Algorithm
When the option to pick a region at random is selected, a region will be picked based on the amount of possible name-combinations for that region. A region with more names is more likely to be picked, and regions with less names are less likely to be picked. I propose having a maximum of 100 male names, 100 female names and 300 last names per region. That's 60.000 possible combinations per region.

The Layout (JSON)
[
  {
    "region": "Region",
    "male": ["Male", "First", "Names"],
    "female": ["Female", "First", "Names"],
    "surnames": ["Last", "Names"]
  },
  {etc}
]
The API
All responses are returned as JSON(P) over HTTP(S). There is currently no request limit. However, please keep the amount of requests to a minimum, and cache responses whenever possible.

Extra Data
Additional random data is served to requests passing an ext parameter. However, response times may be slower, especially when requesting larger quantities of data. All photos are hand-picked from unsplash.com (license):
