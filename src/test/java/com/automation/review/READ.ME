Can  you test web service and what will be your steps/ or how you do it ?


 Endpoints information: where to connect? api.qa-bank.com or ec2-werq-2131.com/api

 Authentication information/credentials. Types of authentication: basic, oauth, oauth 2.0, api key, etc.

 I need to get an information about this web service, first of all documentation (like swagger).
 In swagger, we can see list of requests, how to perform them and list of status codes that are allowed.

 we need some kind of requirement documents to know what is expected, based on them we write test cases.
